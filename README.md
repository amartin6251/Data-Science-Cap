In an effort to reduce the cost of space travel costs, existing data from SpaceX will be used to predict a successful recovery of the first stage of a rocket. Successful recovery practices have already reduced cost per flight by $100M+. 

Data was scraped and wrangled into a Pandas dataframe using get requests, then run through a REST API provided by SpaceX to make the information more user friendly.

Exploratory data analysis was performed with SQL queries to explore larger datasets, then Seaborn and Plotly Express were used as visualization tools to find data relationships on scaled down dataframe samples.
