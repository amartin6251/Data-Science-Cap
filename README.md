In an effort to reduce the cost of space travel costs, existing data from SpaceX will be used to predict a successful recovery of the first stage of a rocket. Successful recovery practices have already reduced cost per flight by $100M+. 
Data was scraped and wrangled into a Pandas dataframe using get requests, then run through a REST API provided by SpaceX to make the information more user friendly.
